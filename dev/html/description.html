				<h2>Toxicity of modern sunscreen. </h2>
				<p>
					UV-rays cause sunburns, photoaging, photosensitivity, age spots and skin cancer.<a class="reference" href="#ref-1">[1]</a> These risks can be significantly reduced by use of sunscreen. 

					There are two types of sunscreen available â€” organic and inorganic. The former contains chemical filters such as Oxybenzone and Octinoxate, which absorb UV radiation by starting a chemical reaction, and the latter contains physical sun blockers such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide, which scatter UVA and UVB rays, thus reflecting it away from your skin.<a class="reference" href="#ref-2">[2]</a>

					These UV-absorbents have the following effects on marine life:
				</p>	
				<ul class="cols">
					<li class="col half">
						Oxybenzone and octinoxate cause bleaching (the loss of endosymbionts) by promoting viral infections<a class="reference" href="#ref-3">[3]</a>, DNA damage, resulting in reproductive diseases, and endocrine disruption.[4]
					</li>
					<li class="col half">
						Nanoparticles of titanium dioxide and zinc oxide exert harmful ecotoxicological effects such as bleaching, inhibition of algal growth and increase the lipid peroxidation of the cell membrane, resulting in the deformation of the membrane structure.[5][6]
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					Every year up to 14,000 tons of sunscreen is being washed into the oceans and seas, resulting in a dramatic increase of the toxicity level and causing a variety of pathologies to corals.[4]
				</p>

				<h2>Mycosporine-Like Amino Acids(MAA).</h2>
				<p>
					Considering all these negative effects on the environment our team decided to look for safer options. Possible alternative to current synthetic UV filters are Mycosporine-Like Amino Acids(MAA). MAAs are small, water-soluble, colorless molecules [7] produced by a variety of marine organisms, including cyanobacteria, fungi, microalgae, and macroalgae[8]. Nowadays, more than 30 different types of MAAs have been identified[9]. The structure of MAAs consists of cyclohexanone or cyclohexenimine chromophore attached with the nitrogen substituent of an amino acid or amino alcohol[10]. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Two types of MAAs, Shinorine and Porphyra-334 (Figure 1), which are originally isolated from red algae Porphyra umbilicalis have relatively high UV-absorption from 310 to 365 nm which covers UV-A and UV-B wavelengths[11]. While  both of them are good UV-sunscreening compounds, porphyra-334 also has anti-aging effects[12] and even works as an antioxidant [13]. Altogether, these compounds can be not only very useful ingredients in sunscreens and other creams but also harmless for marine life as they are protection mechanism of microorganisms[14].
				</p>

							<div class="caption"><i>Figure 1.2.</i> Porphyra 334</div>
						</div>
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>
					The only way of industrial production of MAAs nowadays is to extract them from red algae. This process takes time for the reason that algae are harvested from the wild and have long life cycle. It is also expensive because of the specific conditions (water temperature, nutrients) that these organisms need for growth. Specific lighting conditions are also required for the optimal MAA production and therefore the concentration of these compounds is different from harvest to harvest.[15][16]
				</p>
				<p>
					To date, Helioguard 365 is the first commercially produced natural sunscreen which incorporates MAAs as UV-absorbents, protects skin from photo-aging and helps to prevent the appearance of lines and wrinkles.[17]
